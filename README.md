# GitMarked

An application that helps students to improve their coding prowess by connecting them with mentors.

## Description

A student can sumbit his/her github repo url, while a mentor can then view the full repo tree using the application, add comments to files, and save them. Each comment has corresponding highlighted code sections. Submitted feedback can then be viewed by the student.

## Motivation

The idea for the application was influenced by the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp environment and its strong mentoring culture.

## Notes

This is the final Lighthouse Labs group project effort by John (Sol) Ferguson and Anton Taranenko. The application showcases our coding abilities after a 2 month web development program. It took a week and a half to complete.

There is still room for improvement and a lot of refactoring yet to be done :)
